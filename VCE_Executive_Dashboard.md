## 💰 FINANCIAL REALITY CHECK

### Disclosed Funding vs. True Cost

**CHILD'S i FOUNDATION:**
- Allocated: $16,200
- Estimated Reality: $29,000-45,000
- **GAP: -$12,800 to -28,800 (79-178% underfunded)**

**CAFO:**
- Allocated: $300
- Estimated Reality: $3,250-8,150
- **GAP: -$2,950 to -7,850 (983-2,617% underfunded)**

**SHELTER YETU:**
- Allocated: ❓ Unknown
- Estimated Reality: $24,000-43,000
- **GAP: Unknown (no basis for planning)**

### What This Means:
VCE is committing to deliver $32-53K worth of work with only $16.5K in hand. The organization will either:
1. ❌ Fail to deliver
2. ❌ Deliver at severe loss (subsidizing from other sources)
3. ✅ Renegotiate scope/budget IMMEDIATELY

## 📋 DECISION CHECKLIST FOR LEADERSHIP

- [ ] **RENEGOTIATE** timeline extension (Dec→Feb 2026)
- [ ] **RENEGOTIATE** budget increase ($16.2K→$25-30K)
- [ ] **EXIT** (breach contract, forfeit payment, damage reputation)

**RECOMMENDATION:** ✅ Renegotiate scope OR timeline by Nov 6

---

### CAFO:
- [ ] **CONTINUE** with $300 budget (rely on volunteers, low-cost venue)
- [ ] **SEEK CO-FUNDING** from local churches/county ($1,000-2,000)
- [ ] **SCALE DOWN** to virtual/hybrid event (cost: $0)
- [ ] **POSTPONE** to 2026 when better funded
- [ ] **EXIT** (return $300 grant, notify CAFO)

---

- [ ] **CONTINUE** (only if budget disclosed by Nov 4)
- [ ] **PAUSE** activities until budget disclosed

- [ ] **EXIT** if transparency not forthcoming

**RECOMMENDATION:** ✅ Demand budget disclosure by Nov 4, then decide

---

### TFC Rwanda:

- [ ] **SUSPEND GOVERNANCE** until funded project emerges
- [ ] **RENEGOTIATE** to simpler Letter of Intent vs. full MOU
- [ ] **EXIT** after 1-year anniversary (Feb 2026) if no progress

## 🏆 THE PATH FORWARD

### Three Strategic Choices:

**OPTION A: SURVIVAL MODE** ⚠️ (Not Recommended)
- Continue all MOUs as-is
- Hope for the best
- **RISK:** High probability of multiple failures, staff burnout, reputation damage

**OPTION B: STRATEGIC RETREAT** ✅ (Recommended)
- Renegotiate CiF (scope reduction)
- Scale down/postpone CAFO
- Demand Shelter Yetu transparency
- Suspend ADRA/TFC governance
- **OUTCOME:** Deliver fewer commitments successfully vs. many commitments poorly

**OPTION C: NUCLEAR OPTION** 🔴 (Only if Renegotiation Fails)
- Exit CiF (if they refuse scope reduction)
- Return CAFO grant
- Suspend Shelter Yetu
- Terminate ADRA/TFC
- **OUTCOME:** Short-term reputation damage, but organizational survival

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FOR LEADERSHIP

### What Went Wrong:
1. **Accepted MOUs without capacity assessment** → overcommitment
2. **Accepted budgets below true cost** → operating at loss
3. **No portfolio-level planning** → overlapping deliverables
4. **Weak project management** → no risk registers, WBS, milestones
5. **Accepted non-binding MOUs with governance overhead** → time wasted on dormant partnerships

### What Must Change:
1. ✅ **"No more bad MOUs" policy:** Capacity check before signing
2. ✅ **Minimum project size:** $5,000 (unless truly small scope)
3. ✅ **Overhead rate:** Charge 15% on all projects
4. ✅ **Portfolio dashboard:** Weekly updates mandatory
5. ✅ **Governance discipline:** Board oversight, standup meetings, risk management

### The Bottom Line:
**VCE has good partnerships but inadequate infrastructure to manage them. This is fixable, but requires immediate action and difficult conversations with partners.**
